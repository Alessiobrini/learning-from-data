This repository contains code solutions in the form of Jupyter notebooks for the homeworks and final for the Caltech introductory Machine Learning course (MOOC) **Learning from Data**. The course is taught by [Professor Yaser Abu-Mostafa](https://work.caltech.edu/index.html) and is available at https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html with the associated *course materials* and *video lectures*:

* [Lecture slides](https://work.caltech.edu/lectures.html)
* [Video lectures](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD63A284B7615313A)
* [Homework and Solution Keys](https://work.caltech.edu/homeworks.html)

The code in the notebooks is not great (not the most pythonic in several places!), but it works and I'm still learning python programming. My focus at the moment is learning machine learning theory, techniques and analysis and the challenging homework assignments certainly helped with that.
